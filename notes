3 ways you can run go file
way 1 : go run main.go will start the main function;
way 2 : do go build -o ms.exe | this would create ms.exe file which you can run ./ms.exe
        if you'll do | go build main.go - it will generate main.exe file in same directory;
way 3 : go install  | it will create go-ms.exe in GOBIN location; GOPATH/bin directory;
